# SBEMimage

Open-source acquisition software for serial block-face electron microscopy, made with Python and PyQt. Read the [paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2018.00054/abstract) describing the software.

## Getting started

Please read SBEMimage_Manual.pdf (in the project root folder). It currently contains installation instructions and a short introduction to the software. The document is being expanded into a full manual. Questions? Contact benjamin.titze ÄT fmi.ch
