Acquisition
===========

When you have set up and positioned one or several overview images (OVs) and one or several grids, you can click on the "Start" button in the Main Controls window to start the acquisition. Make sure that you have switched on and focused the beam. You can review several critical settings in a dialog that will pop up before you confirm the start of the acquisition. If the option 'Take overviews' is activated, you will be asked to confirm that the first OV is free from debris.

In the Slice-by-slice viewer, you can inspect a selected tile or overview images in successive slices.
