Installation
============

-------------------
Install Python 3.6+
-------------------

Install Python on the computer on which you wish to run *SBEMimage*. If you are using *DigitalMicrograph* (DM) to control a 3View microtome, the installation must be on the same computer on which DM is running. We recommend the Anaconda Python distribution: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual. Important: Download Python version 3.6 or higher (not 2.7)!

------------------
Download SBEMimage
------------------

Copy all files from the GitHub repository (https://github.com/SBEMimage/SBEMimage) including the folder structure (subdirectories ``src``, ``img``, ``gui``â€¦) into the folder ``C:\pytools\SBEMimage``. You can choose a folder other than ``C:\pytools``, but please ensure the program has full read/write access. The path to ``SBEMimage.py`` should be: ``\SBEMimage\src\SBEMimage.py``.

Important: In the DM communication script ``dm\SBEMimage_DMcom_GMS2.s`` (or the GMS3 version), you have to update the variable ``install_path`` if you use a directory other than ``C:\pytools\SBEMimage``.

Use the command line to switch to the ``SBEMimage`` directory, in which the file ``requirements.txt`` is located and type: ``pip install -r requirements.txt``. This will install all required Python packages to run *SBEMimage*. You can also create a separate Python environment, of course.

---------------------------
First start of the software
---------------------------

If you use *DigitalMicrograph* (DM) to control a 3View microtome, you first have to load and run a script in DM that allows *SBEMimage* to communicate with DM.
Load the script ``SBEMimage_DMcom_GMS2.s`` (for GMS 2) or ``SBEMimage_DMcom_GMS3.s`` (for GMS 3) in DM. It can be found in ``\SBEMimage\dm``. After opening the correct script in DM, click on *Execute*. The message : 'Ready. Waiting for command from SBEMimage...' should be displayed in DM's output window. Further information is provided in the script file.

Now run the main application by executing the batch file ``SBEMimage.bat`` or by typing ``python SBEMimage.py`` in the console window (current directory must be ``\SBEMimage\src``). Select ``default.ini`` in the startup dialog. This default configuration will start *SBEMimage* in simulation mode. The simulation mode should always work because the APIs for the SEM and the microtome are disabled. This mode can be used to get familiar with the *SBEMimage* GUI (Main Controls and Viewport), set up acquisitions, calculate estimates, or look at existing data. If you can run *SBEMimage* in simulation mode, it means that your Python environment works and that the installation was successful.

To switch to the normal application mode, do the following: When you have launched *SBEMimage* with ``default.ini``, save the current configuration under a new name (Top menu: 'Configuration' -> 'Save as new configuration file') . This will be your first custom user configuration. You will also be asked to provide a name for your system configuration (for example, 'Gemini3View_FMI_Basel'). This name will refer to the system settings of your setup (devices, hardware settings, calibrations). All of the future user/project configuration files will link to that system configuration. Now, when you have saved your first custom user configuration file (the new file name should be displayed in the status bar of the Main Controls window, and next to it the system configuration file name), click on ``Configuration`` in the top menu and then on ``Leave simulation mode``. Confirm and restart *SBEMimage* with your new configuration file.

If the communication script is running in *DigitalMicrograph* and the *SmartSEM* remote API is active and set up correctly, the software should now be fully operational. If the APIs cannot be initialized, you will receive an error message when starting up the application.

-----------------------------
System and user configuration
-----------------------------

*SBEMimage* comes with a default system configuration (``system.cfg``) and a default user configuration (``default.ini``). Both can be found in the subdirectory ``cfg``. These files cannot be changed (from within *SBEMimage*) because they are used as templates. They should only be updated by developers when new functionality is added. When you save a new user configuration for the first time, you will be asked to provide a name for a new custom system configuration file. This system configuration file will be linked to all user configurations on your setup.

Your system configuration file contains settings that are setup-specific and usually don't change often. Your user configuration files contain session and workspace-related parameters that change while your are using the software and while an acquisition is running. You can create as many user configuration files as you wish, for example for different users or one configuration file for each acquisition project. Simply open an existing user configuration .ini file (other than default.ini) and save it under a new name.

It's recommended to create a backup of the folder ``\SBEMimage\cfg``, especially of your system configuration file.

-----------
Calibration
-----------

When you have created your first custom user and system configuration files (see above), you must perform several calibration routines to make *SBEMimage* ready for routine use on your setup.

Magnification factor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the top menu in Main Controls, click on 'Calibration' -> 'Magnification calibration'.
Take an image on your SEM with a frame width of either 2048 or 4096 pixels and a pixel size of about 10 nm. In the dialog (see below), select the frame width, pixel size and magnification used for that image, and click on 'Calculate'. Confirm the new value by clicking on 'OK'.

Stage calibration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the top menu in Main Controls, click on 'Calibration' -> 'Stage Calibration' to launch the stage calibration dialog (see below). Start the automatic stage calibration procedure. Click on the button with the question mark for more information.

Motor speeds
^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the top menu in Main Controls, click on 'Calibration' -> 'Stage Calibration' (same dialog window as for the stage calibration above).
Start the automatic motor speed measurement to update the motor speeds.

Cut cycle duration
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In the top menu in Main Controls, click on 'Calibration' -> 'Microtome cut duration'.
Set the cut duration of a full cycle in seconds. If you are using DigitalMicrograph, you can read the cut duration in the DM output log after running a cut cycle with *SBEMimage*.
