About
=====

*SBEMimage* is an open-source Python application to run acquisitions with scanning electron microscopes, in particular for serial block-face imaging. Read the `paper <https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncir.2018.00054/abstract>`_.

The latest version is *2020.12*. For users who are not familiar with Python, it is recommended to download the Windows 7/10 installer.

The development of *SBEMimage* at the Friedrich Miescher Institute in Basel has been supported by the Novartis Research Foundation and by the European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme (Grant Agreement No. 742576). Other institutes that have substantially contributed to SBEMimage development/testing: EPFL, Lausanne, Switzerland (CIME/BioEM); Francis Crick Institute, London, UK.

Current development team: Benjamin Titze (`btitze <https://github.com/btitze>`_), Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research, Basel, Switzerland (lead developer); Thomas Templier, Janelia Research Campus; Joost de Folter, Francis Crick Institute; Philipp Schubert, Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology; and `others <https://github.com/SBEMimage/SBEMimage/graphs>`_.
